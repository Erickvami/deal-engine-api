        ... or...
        npm run build
        npm start

    git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/flight-service-api.git
   ```

## Endpoints
    
`GET /api/flights`: Retrieve all flights with weather report by airport.

`GET /api/flights/from/:IATA_CODE`: Retrieve all flights by origin IATA code.

`GET /api/flights/to/:IATA_CODE`: Retrieve all flights by destination IATA code.

## Error management
Errors are managed in their respective services logging descriptions about the issue. In case the origin is not from a service or there is no catch for it then it goes directly to the middleware `error-handler.ts` which will automatically throw a 500 error to the user with the description.
